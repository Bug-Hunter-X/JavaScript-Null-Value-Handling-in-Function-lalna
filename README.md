# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript: handling null values in function parameters. The example shows how the function handles null values, but also discusses the importance of careful consideration of what behavior is correct when handling null inputs in your application.  Different scenarios may require different handling, such as throwing exceptions or using a different default value.  The solution file offers an alternative approach to show better flexibility.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred code editor or IDE.
3. Run the JavaScript code using Node.js or a similar environment. 

## Potential Improvements

This repository highlights the importance of clear specifications and careful consideration when writing functions that must deal with the possibility of null or undefined arguments.  A robust function would either clearly state its behavior with nulls in documentation, and/or would handle the situation in a way that prevents unexpected errors.  Always carefully think about whether throwing an error, returning a default value, or another approach is best for your use case.
